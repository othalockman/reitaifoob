I was, until recently, a long time FreeNAS user, running an old P3 that sat over the in the corner until the MicroSD I was using for the boot drive decided it didn't want to work anymore. I was using the old box as a file server (I'm a freelancer or many hats, but mainly graphic designer that dabbles in video production) and used it as a DLNA server for our house.

Long time lurker, first time poster on this subreddit. Just wanted to say that there's too much focus on hardware on this forum. There's a lot of people asking for hardware recommendations and people almost automatically responding with "you definitely need a quad processor" or "no FreeNAS setup is complete without at least 16 GB of ECC RAM".
